# jerry_old
This is an very old attemp to implement a fancy applicaiton server for C++ - similar to TOMCAT for JAVA.

Don't use this code. It is really very old and absolutly not stabel. It uses zsystem_old as well - another reason why it is unstable.
But you can use it to get some ideas. It implements a poor simple HTTP protocol from scratch and it also includes a small widget library to make easy web apps - a calulator is included as an example.

I have real **new** implementation already in my pipe and it has nothing similar with this code. So, please look soon at the **real JERRY** implementation.
